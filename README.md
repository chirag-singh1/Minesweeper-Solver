# Minesweeper-Solver

## Setup
After cloning the repository, run the commands: 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will build the `minesweeper` executable. Running the minesweeper executable will open a terminal window with the Minesweeper game on it. Run the program with the `-h` flag for an idea of the setup options and user controls.

## Cleanup
Run `rm -rf build` to remove the build folder.
